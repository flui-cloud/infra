# Cloud Provider Capability Matrix

This document defines what Flui expects from a cloud provider and how it behaves when
a capability is absent. Use it to assess a new provider before starting integration.

All levels are considered **required** for full integration — none are optional.
A provider missing a level will have reduced functionality as described in the behavior table below.

See also [`PROVIDER_STANDARD.md`](PROVIDER_STANDARD.md) for a provider-agnostic capability manifesto.

---

## Capability Levels

### Level 1 — Base

Server lifecycle management. Without this a provider cannot be used at all.

| Capability | Interface method |
|------------|----------------|
| Create server | `ICloudProvider.createServer()` |
| Delete server | `ICloudProvider.deleteServer()` |
| Get server status | `ICloudProvider.getServerStatus()` |
| List servers | `ICloudProvider.listServersAsDto()` |
| Get server details | `ICloudProvider.getServerDetailsAsDto()` |
| Health check | `ICloudProvider.testConnection()` |
| Resource labels/tags | `createServer(config.labels)` |

---

### Level 2 — Hourly billing / Pay-as-you-go

The provider must support server creation **billed per hour** with no minimum commitment.
This is the economic prerequisite for autoscale: nodes are created on-demand and destroyed
when no longer needed — monthly-only billing makes autoscale cost-neutral at best.

| Requirement | How to verify |
|-------------|--------------|
| Hourly rate available | `ICloudProvider.getNodeSizes()` returns `pricing.hourly > 0` |
| No minimum commitment | Provider API allows delete at any time |
| Billing stops on delete | Confirmed by provider documentation |

> **Without this level**: autoscale is technically possible but economically inefficient.
> Flui will not restrict creation/deletion, but cost savings are not guaranteed.

---

### Level 3 — SSH Key Registry

SSH keys registered globally on the provider account, passed to servers at creation via `ssh_keys[]`.

| Capability | Interface method |
|------------|----------------|
| Create SSH key | `ICloudProvider.createSSHKey()` |
| Delete SSH key | `ICloudProvider.deleteSSHKey()` |
| Get SSH key | `ICloudProvider.getSSHKey()` |
| List SSH keys | `ICloudProvider.listSSHKeys()` |

> **Without this level**: the bootstrap public key is injected into `user_data` (cloud-init fallback).
> Cluster creation still works, but key rotation requires reprovisioning nodes.

---

### Level 4 — Firewall

Network-level firewalls applied to servers at creation or afterwards.

| Capability | Interface method |
|------------|----------------|
| Create firewall | `IFirewallProvider.createFirewall()` |
| Delete firewall | `IFirewallProvider.deleteFirewall()` |
| Apply to servers | `IFirewallProvider.applyToServers()` |
| Update rules | `IFirewallProvider.updateFirewallRules()` |

> **Without this level**: clusters are created without firewall rules.
> Port 6443 (K3s API) will be exposed to the internet — not recommended for production.

---

### Level 5 — DNS

Manage DNS zones and records for cluster domains.

| Capability | Interface method |
|------------|----------------|
| List zones | `IDnsProvider.listZones()` |
| Create record | `IDnsProvider.createRecord()` |
| Update record | `IDnsProvider.updateRecord()` |
| Delete record | `IDnsProvider.deleteRecord()` |

> **Without this level**: DNS is not managed by Flui. Users configure DNS manually.

---

### Level 6 — VNet / Private Network

Connect cluster nodes via private networking (no internet traffic between nodes).

| Capability | Interface method |
|------------|----------------|
| Create VNet | `INetworkProvider.createVNet()` |
| Delete VNet | `INetworkProvider.deleteVNet()` |
| Attach server | `INetworkProvider.attachServerToVNet()` |
| Detach server | `INetworkProvider.detachServerFromVNet()` |

> **Without this level**: nodes communicate over public IPs. K3s traffic is encrypted
> (WireGuard), but latency and egress costs may be higher.

---

### Level 7 — Power management

Start/stop individual servers without deleting them.

| Capability | Interface method |
|------------|----------------|
| Power on | `ICloudProvider.powerOnServer()` |
| Power off | `ICloudProvider.powerOffServer()` |

> **Without this level**: power operations are not available via Flui API.

---

## Current capability matrix

| Provider | L1 Base | L2 Hourly | L3 SSH | L4 Firewall | L5 DNS | L6 VNet | L7 Power |
|----------|:-------:|:---------:|:------:|:-----------:|:------:|:-------:|:--------:|
| Hetzner  | ✓       | ✓         | ✓      | ✓           | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |
| Scaleway | ✓       | ✓ ¹       | ✓      | ✓           | ✓      | ✓       | —        |

¹ Scaleway Instances (VMs): hourly billing available — suitable for autoscale.
  Scaleway Elastic Metal (bare metal): monthly contracts — **not suitable for autoscale**.
  Use resource prefix `instance:` for autoscale candidates; exclude `baremetal:`.

## OS image requirements for K3s nodes

| Requirement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| OS | Ubuntu **24.04 LTS** |
| Architecture | **x86_64 (amd64) only** — ARM not supported |
| cloud-init / user_data | Required |
| SSH port | 22 |
| Minimum for master/worker | 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM, 40 GB disk |

**Image identifiers by provider:**

| Provider | Image slug / ID |
|----------|----------------|
| Hetzner  | `ubuntu-24.04` |
| Scaleway | Ubuntu 24.04 Noble Numbat (`ubuntu_noble` or latest equivalent) |

---

## Behavior when a capability is missing

| Missing capability | Flui behavior |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Hourly billing (L2) | Autoscale not economically viable; no API restriction but no cost savings |
| SSH Key Registry (L3) | Bootstrap key injected via cloud-init `user_data` (automatic fallback) |
| Firewall (L4) | Cluster created without firewall — warning in log, not blocking |
| DNS (L5) | DNS not configured by Flui — user manages manually |
| VNet (L6) | Nodes not on private network — traffic over public IPs |
| Power management (L7) | Power endpoints unavailable |

---

## Authentication model

Flui uses static API tokens only (`X-Auth-Token` or `Bearer`).
OAuth / OIDC on the provider side is not supported.

Credentials are stored encrypted at rest in `ProviderCredentialsEntity`
via `KeyStorageService`. Retrieved at runtime via `ICredentialProvider.getActiveApiToken()`.

---

## Autoscale prerequisites (future)

When autoscale is implemented, the provider must satisfy:

1. `getNodeSizes()` returns types with `pricing.hourly > 0` AND `architecture === 'x86'`
2. `createServer()` completes in under 3 minutes (typical cloud VM boot)
3. `deleteServer()` terminates billing immediately

No interface changes are needed today — `NodeSizeDto.architecture` and `pricing.hourly`
already exist. The autoscale controller will filter candidates using these fields.
